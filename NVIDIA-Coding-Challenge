1.Product Line Revenue (NVIDIA SQL Interview Questions)

let's suppose as a business analyst on the revenue forecasting team at NVIDIA, you are given a table of NVIDIA product_info and transactions happened in 2021(say).

> Write a query to summarize the total sales revenue for each product line. The product line with the highest revenue should be at the top of the results.
> Layout of product_info Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
product_name	varchar
product_line	varchar

> Product_info datset:
product_id	product_name	product_line
1	Quadro RTX 8000	GPU
2	Quadro RTX 6000	GPU
3	GeForce RTX 3060	GPU
4	BlueField-3	DPU

> Layout of transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
transaction_id	integer
product_id	integer
amount	integer

> transactions dataset:
transaction_id	product_id	amount
101	1	5000
102	2	4200
103	3	9000
104	4	7000

Example Output:
product_line	total_revenue
GPU	18200
DPU	7000

> SQL query shown below: 

SELECT product_id,product_line,SUM(amount) AS total_sales_revenue
FROM 
(SELECT p.product_id,p.product_name,p.product_line,t.amount
FROM product_info p JOIN transactions t ON p.product_id = t.product_id)
GROUP BY product_line
ORDER BY total_sales_revenue desc;

Breakdown of the above query:
We have used the subquery concepy here to extract the desired output. here, we have firstly join the two datasets (Product_info and transactions) to get the amount on the commmom key present in both the tablesand then we have 
summarized the total sales revenue using the aggregate function (SUM()) over amount as total_sales_amount (This is alias) and then grouped the data on product_line as per the requirement of the probelm statement.
