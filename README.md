Hey Folks,
This side Anmol Tomar, working as Data Enginner from past 2.5 years and just to contribute to the Github community and to share my knowledge regarding mainly over Transformation part, optimization and tuning the queries as well which is the backbone of any Data Engineer to perform the same on daily basis while dealing with the data (mainly with the Big data).

here, we will talk about few below points:

> What the project does?
All the projects which is there at the moment or will be there in future is all about the Advanced SQL transaction/Spark transformations and the optimization for the same will be there.

> Why the project is useful?
These project can be useful for any Data Engineer for the reference or might be for the Data Engineer Aspirants who are trying to put their feet into data enginering world to grasp the knowledge and adhere the same in their projects.

> How users can get started with the project?
As per my experience as of now to get started with any project related to SQL, SPARK, PYTHON, AZURE Date Engineering projects, one must need to clear all the fundamentals very well and then try to write/Build small small chunks of codes and try to understand their behaviour in the system.
and start watching the Vedio lectures for the same ( can take up Udemy courses, Coursera as per users choice) and parallely start building them to get the thorough understanding for the same.

Futher, i am thrilled to share my knowledge as a contibution to this GITHUB community!!
