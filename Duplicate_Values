Ques: To find out the Duplicate records from the table as shown below in the schema on the basis of first_name and last_name..


-- Create the Schema.
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
  empId INTEGER,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
   last_name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Insert the values..
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0001, 'John', 'Doe');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0002, 'Jane', 'Smith');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0003, 'John', 'Doe');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0004, 'Emily', 'Davis');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0005, 'Michael', 'Brown');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0006, 'Jane', 'Smith');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0007, 'Emily', 'Davis');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0008, 'Emily', 'Davis');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0009, 'David', 'Clark');
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0010, 'John', 'Doe');

-- Method-1 to find the duplicate record on single row i.e. first_name

select first_name,count(first_name) as first_name_counter
from EMPLOYEE
group by first_name
having count(first_name) >1;


--Method-2 To find the duplicate record on multiples row i.e. first_name and last_name

SELECT first_name,last_name,count(*) as counter 
from EMPLOYEE
group by first_name,last_name
having count(*) > 1;
*/

--Method-3 To find duplicate record by using row_number() Windows function..
WITH CTE1 as (SELECT empId,first_name,last_name,
row_number() over (partition by first_name,last_name order by empId) as rn,
count(*) over (partition by first_name,last_name) as dup_count  
from EMPLOYEE)

select * from CTE1
where rn > 1;

--Method -4 To find the duplicate record by using Count Aggregate window functions..
WITH CTE1 as (SELECT *,
count(*) over (partition by first_name,last_name) as dup_count  
from EMPLOYEE)

select * from CTE1
where dup_count > 1;
